# C++ Refresher Project

A basic C++ project structure for me to refresh on fundamental concepts. This repo provides examples for the following topics:

- Using CMake and googletest
- Modern C++ topics (C++20)
- Fundamental data structures and algorithms

## Setting up

I use Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and Mac interchangebly, and after going through a bunch of IDEs and build systems, I settled on CMake for cross-platform C++ development. Clone the repo and use whatever CMake you have.
